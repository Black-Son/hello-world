Hi guys.

I'm exceptionally new to web development but my interest only grows as I delve deeper into the work. I haven't done much but have witnessed how frustrating some things can be especially when one does not pay attention to what they are doing.

However, I'm optimistic about the future and what this journey has to offer. I hope to meet brilliant minds that I can collaborate with and create products that will change lives. I hope to one day work for Elon Musk as I admire his tenacity and broadness of thought. He has a strong will and the work ethic to support his almost unworldy goals. Working with that man will be a dream come true for me.

I've come to understand that patience is a vrtue hence I'm giving my all to understand what I'm doing. My gift is writing and I've pursued that over the years, so it's quite a shift from an entirely creative vocation to one that depends so much on technical ability as the foundation for creativity, it's almost as if I'm working backwards. But I have a growth mentality and I understand that with consistent effort and enormous focus I will reach my goal.

This is only the beginning.
